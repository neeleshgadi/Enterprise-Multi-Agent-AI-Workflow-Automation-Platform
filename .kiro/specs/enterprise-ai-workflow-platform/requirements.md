# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enterprise Multi-Agent AI Workflow Automation Platform is a cloud-deployed AI system that uses multiple specialized AI agents to autonomously execute complex business workflows for enterprise clients. The platform processes legal documents, generates reports, answers queries, and updates CRM systems in real-time using an agentic AI RAG system with tool-using agents, context memory, multi-tenant capability, streaming data ingestion, and enterprise-level security and monitoring - all built with free and open-source technologies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Agent Orchestration System

**User Story:** As an enterprise client, I want multiple specialized AI agents to work together seamlessly, so that complex business workflows can be executed autonomously without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workflow is initiated THEN the system SHALL deploy a Data Ingestion Agent, Analysis Agent, Report Generator Agent, Action Agent, and Supervisor Agent
2. WHEN agents are deployed THEN the Supervisor Agent SHALL coordinate all other agents and manage workflow execution
3. WHEN the Data Ingestion Agent is active THEN it SHALL pull files from email and ERP systems using free APIs
4. WHEN the Analysis Agent receives documents THEN it SHALL use RAG to process documents and extract insights
5. WHEN the Report Generator Agent is triggered THEN it SHALL create business-ready PDFs and spreadsheets
6. WHEN the Action Agent is activated THEN it SHALL update external systems through available free APIs

### Requirement 2: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System

**User Story:** As a business user, I want the system to provide accurate, context-aware responses based on my organization's documents, so that I can get relevant insights without manual document review.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents are uploaded THEN the system SHALL store them in a free vector database (FAISS)
2. WHEN a query is submitted THEN the system SHALL use semantic search to find relevant documents
3. WHEN relevant documents are found THEN the system SHALL use a free open-source LLM to generate responses
4. WHEN processing queries THEN the system SHALL implement metadata filtering for improved accuracy
5. WHEN the vector database reaches capacity THEN the system SHALL handle millions of documents efficiently using FAISS

### Requirement 3: Real-Time Data Processing

**User Story:** As an enterprise administrator, I want the system to process data in real-time from various sources, so that business decisions can be made with the most current information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external systems send data THEN the platform SHALL process it using event-driven architecture
2. WHEN data streams are active THEN the system SHALL continuously ingest from CRM, ERP, and webhook sources
3. WHEN data is received THEN the system SHALL process it without blocking other operations
4. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms and error handling

### Requirement 4: Multi-Tenant SaaS Architecture

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to serve multiple enterprise clients securely, so that each organization's data and workflows remain completely isolated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new enterprise client is onboarded THEN the system SHALL create isolated data storage and processing environments
2. WHEN clients access the platform THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based access controls
3. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL authenticate using JWT tokens and implement rate limiting
4. WHEN clients use the platform THEN their workflows SHALL remain completely separate from other tenants
5. WHEN administrators need oversight THEN the system SHALL provide a dashboard for monitoring active agents and tasks

### Requirement 5: Observability and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities, so that I can ensure system health and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL collect metrics using free monitoring tools (Prometheus)
2. WHEN metrics are collected THEN they SHALL be visualized using free dashboards (Grafana)
3. WHEN system events occur THEN they SHALL be traced using OpenTelemetry
4. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged using free logging solutions (ELK stack alternatives)
5. WHEN performance issues arise THEN administrators SHALL receive alerts through the monitoring system

### Requirement 6: Free/Open-Source Technology Stack

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want the entire platform built using free and open-source technologies, so that operational costs are minimized while maintaining enterprise-grade functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing the backend THEN the system SHALL use Python with FastAPI and LangGraph
2. WHEN implementing AI models THEN the system SHALL use free open-source LLMs (Ollama, Hugging Face models)
3. WHEN storing vector data THEN the system SHALL use FAISS as the vector database
4. WHEN building the frontend THEN the system SHALL use Next.js with TailwindCSS
5. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL use Docker containers with free orchestration options
6. WHEN handling data streaming THEN the system SHALL use Apache Kafka or similar free alternatives
7. WHEN tracking experiments THEN the system SHALL use MLflow or similar free MLOps tools

### Requirement 7: Deployment and Scalability

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the platform to be deployable on free cloud tiers and scale efficiently, so that we can demonstrate enterprise capabilities without incurring costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL run on free cloud tiers (AWS Free Tier, Google Cloud Free Tier, or local deployment)
2. WHEN containerizing THEN the system SHALL use Docker for consistent deployment across environments
3. WHEN scaling is needed THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling of individual components
4. WHEN APIs are accessed THEN they SHALL be publicly available with proper documentation
5. WHEN the system grows THEN it SHALL maintain performance within free tier limitations

### Requirement 8: Security and Authentication

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want enterprise-grade security features, so that sensitive business data is protected according to industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users authenticate THEN the system SHALL use JWT-based authentication
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. WHEN data is stored THEN it SHALL be encrypted at rest using free encryption libraries
4. WHEN data is transmitted THEN it SHALL be encrypted in transit using HTTPS/TLS
5. WHEN access is granted THEN it SHALL follow principle of least privilege

### Requirement 9: Documentation and Demo Capabilities

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want comprehensive documentation and a working demo, so that the platform's capabilities can be clearly demonstrated to potential users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is complete THEN it SHALL include a clean, documented GitHub repository
2. WHEN reviewing the architecture THEN there SHALL be clear microservices and data flow diagrams
3. WHEN demonstrating capabilities THEN there SHALL be a web UI showing running agents, progress, and logs
4. WHEN technical details are needed THEN there SHALL be a technical report detailing RAG implementation and agent orchestration
5. WHEN accessing the platform THEN there SHALL be live deployment with public API endpoints
